# PDSC – Plan · Design · Solve · Create

**PDSC** is an autonomous student organization based at the **Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering (IOE), Nepal**. We exist to bridge the gap between academia and the real world by creating opportunities for students to gain hands-on experience, explore interdisciplinary collaboration, and build future-ready skills.

Through curated workshops, hackathons, design challenges, and knowledge-sharing sessions, we bring learning to life — beyond classrooms and into the world of solving actual problems.
